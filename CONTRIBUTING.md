# Contributing 

Want to contribute? Great to know! eSim and Arduino on Cloud is an open source project and we welcome contributions from all. We would be very happy to collaborate with you. To contribute to this project please make sure that you first discuss with us and follow the guidelines given.

## Types of contributions
Contributions can be of different types. Some are listed below.
* Report a bug
* Suggest a feature
* Fix a bug
* Improve UI
* Contribute a new feature
* Update documentation

## Reporting Bug / Suggesting Features
If you just want to report a bug in our system or want to suggest a new feature or improve UI, etc., then first browse through our existing issues to check whether this has been addressed or not. If not, feel free to create a new issue. Please read the  [new issue guidelines](https://esim-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/NewIssue.html) given.

## Step 1: Assign/Create Issues

### Existing issues
* Before you start contributing, first browse through the existing issues and pull requests to know whether someone else has already fixed or is already working on it.
* If an issue is already created but no one is assigned to it, create a comment 'Assignee: @YourGitHubUsername'. This will let the community know that you are addressing this issue.
* Just a suggestion: If you are a new contributor you can look at issues tagged as 'good first issue' tag. These are comparatively smaller and easier to address than the other ones.

### New issues
* Before you create a new issue on GitHub, first discuss your ideas about the new feature or notify the bug on our appropriate Discord channels. Our contributors will interact with you and help you take it further. 
* Once the feature is approved or the bug is confirmed, based on your discussion with the contributors on our discord channel, create a new issue on GitHub. Please read the [guidelines](https://esim-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/NewIssue.html) for creating a new issue.

### Inactivity Period
* If you have assigned the issue to yourself (existing or new), we request you to be active on your forked repository.
* There might be a situation when you have other priorities or sometimes you might be taking a break, etc., wherein you may not be able to contribute to your forked repo for more than 3 weeks. 
* In such a case, we request you to just ping us on Discord and inform us about it also mentioning your inactivity period.
* An inactivity of over 3 weeks in your repo or no discussion on Discord, without prior intimation, will be considered that you are no longer interested. In such a case the assignee name will be removed so that the issue can be solved by someone else. You are however free to assign it to yourself again when you are available, if the issue is not assigned to someone else.

## Step 2: Fork Repository 
* The first step is to fork the repository so that you have your own repository in which you can work on.
* Create a **new branch** (feature or bugfix) from the **Develop** branch and work on the newly created branch. This way if we make some changes to the Develop branch in our repo, you can upstream it at anytime for maintaining the updated codebase.

## Step 3: Contribute
* Once the branch created, you can start contributing (coding, documentation, test cases, etc.). Make sure that you follow the [contributing guidelines](https://esim-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/ContributingGuidelines.html).
* We use GitHub Actions for continuous integrations that runs linting and testing operations.
* There might be some changes to the original repository which will not reflect in your forked repository automatically. If you want to update it, sync it using the steps given in the link: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

## Step 4: Make a pull request
* When you feel that you are ready to merge your contributions into our repository, create a pull request **from your feature/bugfix branch to our Develop** branch.
* Select an appropriate label from the list E.g. enhancement, bug fix, etc.
* Please go through the [pull request guidelines](https://esim-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/PullRequest.html).
* Our reviewing team will review your pull request made and will interact with you by posting comments. You may be asked to modify incase there is any issue.
* We request you to be active in responding to our comments so as to merge/close the issue.
* Incase you do not respond to our comments within a week, we will close it. Feel free to open it again when you are ready to interact.
