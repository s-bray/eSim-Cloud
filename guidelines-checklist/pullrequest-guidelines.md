# Pull request
A pull request is one of the most essential parts of sharing your contributions with us. Please make sure that you read and follow the guidelines. This will help us in accepting the pull request easily.

## Guidelines
* Each pull request should be for a single feature or addressing a single problem only.
* Avoid handling multiple features or bug fixes into one pull request.
* Ensure that you create it for the appropriate branch only.
* Write a brief description about your contribution and what problem does it solve. A pull request with good description is always appreciated and will be accepted easily.
* Once the pull request is made, GitHub actions will show linting errors if any and the different test results. If all goes well then ‘All checks have passed’ will be displayed on your pull request. If any one fails, you can check the details and act accordingly.
