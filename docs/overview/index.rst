eSim on Cloud
#############

This system allows the users to draw analog and digital circuits and simulate them. The users have a facility to drag and drop components from the left pane onto the schematic grid on the right pane. The components on the grid are connected using wires. The circuit can then be simulated using the different simulation parameters (DC Solver, DC Sweep, Transient analysis, and AC analysis). The basic ERC check enables the users to find out errors if any. The size of the schematic grid can be changed from A1 to A5 paper sizes along with portrait and landscape modes. The users can also print the circuit or save it in pdf format for documentation purposes.


Arduino on Cloud
#############

This system allows the users to drag and drop Arduino components from the left pane onto the working space on the right. The pins of the Arduino board can be connected to various input/output devices like LED, motor, push button, etc using wires. There is also a facility to change the color of wires, LEDs, and such components, so as to differentiate the easily. The users can then proceed to write their code in the code window which is then  simulated. There is an option for the users to print or save it in pdf format for documentation purposes. The basic ERC check enables the users to find out errors if any.
