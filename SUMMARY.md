DHT Sensor has been added by importing an SVG model file. Subsequent Json file had to be created for the sensor to appear in simulator. Utils.ts was also edited accordingly. DHT11.ts in /input directory was also made. Demo has got recorded videos of the integration done of externally edited sensors.


Recent changes has got the L293D Motor Driver IC Succesfully integrated, Demo videos of the same is also uploaded. The ".ts" file was a bit tricky to make out as the pins of L293D have 3 extra GND Pins. The connection was changed for working w.r.t the L293D IC working. All 4 GND pins were uploaded as GND1 GND2 GND3 GND4 seperately in the ".json" file so as the ".ts" file does not shows an error.
